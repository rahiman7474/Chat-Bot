# Chat-Bot
This project is a fully functional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to answer questions based on the Mahabharata and Ramayana epics. It allows users to interact with a custom PDF containing textual information about mythological characters and get context-aware answersâ€”all without relying on paid APIs or cloud-hosted models.
